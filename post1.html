        Start with lining the cake mold with baking paper. Then melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Put coconut cookies into the blender.
        Mix the cookies and then add butter and work with the blender until you get the consistency of a wet sand.<br />
        Line the bottom of the cheesecake in a cake mold and press it neatly to the bottom. Put the mold in the fridge while making cheesecake mass.<br />
        In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with honey to a fluffy consistency. In a separate bowl whip the cream stiffly.<br />
        It's time to create a cheesecake mass - for this combine the contents of both bowls. You can use a blender for this, but only use it to combine the ingredients. At the very end, pour in the coconut shreds and mix again, this time by hand.<br />
        Take out the form with the bottom of the cake from the fridge and put half the cheesecake mass in it.<br />
        In the blender mix Bounty bars and form a flat mass, which gently put on the first layer of cheesecake.<br />
        Finish the cheesecake with the remaining cheesecake mass and level it with a spatula. Now you have to put the cheesecake in the fridge for at least 4 hours, although I recommend leaving it there all night.<br />
        Decorate with cocoa, white chocolate topping, and/or some more cut Bounty candy bars.<br /><br />
